### The bad on LNR
No front running protection makes LNR vulnerable to hostage styled front running.  

Bytes32 type used in the Contract for _name means names cant be > 32bytes (no long emoji names).  

There is no extension associated with the project (such as .og). This is a major fault for a naming system.
This allows users to register existing TLD / extensions for impersonation, spams, squatting.
